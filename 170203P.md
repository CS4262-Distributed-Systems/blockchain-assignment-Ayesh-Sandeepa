Each participant in the blockchain mainitains its own ledger that represents the blockchain state. Therefore it is not feasible to one party to tamper with it.

#### Consensus
Blockchains use consensus algrithms(Proof of work, Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance etc.) to maintain a consistent ledger among all its participants.
